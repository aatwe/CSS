Even without CSS HTML elements have predefined rules for how displayed on webpage

So even if we have no CSS -> how webpage should be displayed	

Rules:
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
1) Content is everything
 	Inline element take as much width & heaight as content in it.
	Block element: width even though width 100% , height still determined by content
    Content is first thing that determines how large small things get displayed
     Despite CSS

2) Order of elements from Code
   for ex
    <img>
    <h1> </h1>
    <p> </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> </p>

3)CHildren sit on top of parents on stack //Z Axis
<div>
 <h1>A <span>Pro </span> grammer</h1>	//Default rules for 
 </div>
//h1 wont be visible if div was infront of h1 -> solution? use position : relative

4) CSS Position Property
   a) Static      : What is static? go along with html rules and keep to default html flow
   b) Relative  : Relative positioning : Positions element relative to how it would have been positioned
	    had it been static
	..coordinate properties: top, bottom, left, right
	//without coordinate property position: relative does nothing
	//Does it shift/affect other elements? No
	    img {
		position: relative
		left:30px;		//image is pushed 30 px from left towards right of previous position
				//left means margin from left	
}
   c) Absolute
	//Affects flow of html	
     div{
        position: relative
}
   img{
        position: absolute
        right: 30px;	//Image shifts to the right by 30px
}		//Image is relative to parent element
 
  d) Fixed :
	position: fixed
	As we scroll through website, position of element is fixed despite not scrolling
	//used in nav bar/ side bar

Ex.
1) Given: parent container w 4 boxes
//index.html
<div class=”parent”>
 <div class=”box” id=”one”>One</div>
 <div class=”box” id=”two”>Two</div>
 <div class=”box” id=”three”>Three</div>
 <div class=”box” id=”four”>Four</div>
</div>

//styles.css
.parent {
 border: 2px black dotted;		//if not specified, by default position : static
 display: inline-block;
}
.box {
 display: inline-block;		//if not specified, by default position : static	
 background: red;
 width: 100px;
 height: 100px;
}
#two {
  background: green;		//if not specified, by default position : static
}


-> Relative Position

 2a) move greenbox / #2 -> can move with top/left/right/bottom properties but only relative to current position

#two {
  top: 20px;
  left: 20px;
  background: green;
  position: relative;
}

-> absolute Position     ->  can move with top/left/right/bottom properties but only  relative to parent

#two {
  top: 20px;
  left: 20px;
  background: green;
  position: absolute;
}	

-> static Position 	-> cannot move with top/left/right/bottom
