h1 font size = 90px
What if someone changes these font styles -> Preferences -> font size -> small


What is 
font size = 2en   //Phonetic pronounciation of letter m
We know  <en></en> tag to italicize

But 1 em = width of Capital letter M
1 EM = 16 px

World website: em vss % vs px

ems and % are added to parent's
However px are not overrided and added from parent


How to avoid this? rem : root em
5.62rem ignores parent settings and sets to 5.62 rem
//rem is less likely to go wrong
1 rem = 16px
