Q) Why use block elements?
Ans
Cannot change width height of inline elements. Can change width height of block

Q) drawback of block elemet?
Ans
But block element doesnt let any other element sit on same line


Q) How to Change display property of  block element & make it sit on same line //display: inline
Ans
//This will make paragraph inline element,  and allows to sit next to each other on same line
p{
  background-color: red;
  width: 100px;  
  display: inline;
}

Q) How to change display property of inline element? //display : block
span{
display: block;
background-color:blue;
width: 100px;
}
//Doesnt let sit on same line

Q) How to get best of both worlds? Use display : inline-block property

p{
background-color: red;
width: 100px;
display: inline-block
}
______________________________________________________________________________
//We treat images as inline-block elements  //can set width and can sit on same line


Q) How to make element disappear?s
Method 1				//display: None Property
					   display: none;
<p class= second-p> World </p>
.second-p{
display: none;
}
	//World paragraph wont be visible
	//Other Elements will ignore it

Method 2 :				 //Another way to make element disappear? visbility property
					//visibility: hidden;
//element still keeps original position just not visible.
All elements will flow around it


Ex1) Underline only Pro part of Programmer ? Use inline element Span, Give span class name = pro , style this class
		    <p>Programmer</p>
		    <p>A <span class="pro">Pro</span> grammer</p>

We want to underline only pro

1) Split paragraph into 3 paragraphs , give class, and style differently using tet-decoration: underline

2) Why Span?
Span is an inline display element not a block display element
Inline display element only takes as much space as it needs to in height and width
//The box around span part : pro will be only as long  and wide as pro
//Basically enter Pro in a span class named as pro
      <p>A <span class="pro">Pro</span> grammer</p>
//Style this class


//Pro(underlined) and grammer will both show next to each other
Why? because inline elements
Inline elements do not block other elements from occuring on same line
