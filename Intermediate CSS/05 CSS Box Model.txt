we know every single html element = treated as box by CSS
By styling box: can determine how elements can be laid out


How to view box model?
Everytime we inspect an html element
can check box model as below, can test adding padding etc in this box model


img{ width: 100%;}
//What happens?
Width of the box scales to fill entire width of screen



Box Model:
A Div we have given background color
It has : height + width 300px

What can we specify for an element?
Width + Height + Border + Paddings + margin

Changing height to 600 px
Div expands vertically pushing down any  div or elements that are not inside this current container
Do same for width


How to specify these values? static pixels or % is of viewport
What is viewport? screen that we are viewing the website on? 
Laptop/Mobile/Ipad screen

How to specify border? Solid
note height and width dont include border 

{border-width: 0px 10px 20px 30px;}
Clockwise dimensions


Padding? scroll below in styles tab -> double click place o enter number -
Little space bw text and border
padding pads content, not the bg image and bg colorx

Margin?
Buffer zone for an element bw 2 potential elements(each has margin)
