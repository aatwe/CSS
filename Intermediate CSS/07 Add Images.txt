Create new folder in CSS-My	Site : images

Add in top container:


<img src="images/cloud.png" alt="cloud-img">
<img src="images/cloud.png" alt="cloud-img">
      <img src="images/mountain.png" alt="mountain-img">


But these are not alligned
Cloud and mountain are in 1 line below


Why?
CSS Display properties

Check the box around cloud/ mountain/ cloud2 / h1
clount, mountain are only as long as the image

But box around h1 and paragraph : are as long as page width

Some elements are block display : h1 / p / ul : take whole width of screen
