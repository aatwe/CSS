Div = content division element, allows to split/divide content into separate containers/boxes
Helps us to affect  layout of each box separately
Allows divide content so we can structure each div separately

Why are we talking about html element in this css module?
Div dont do anything unless we use css with it

Top part has thicker of line
Inspect	:

1) Top part has thicker line	 
2) Select div -> 1424 x 0


Lets specify css for the div in chrome developer tools

_____________________________________________________________________
Experiment in div element:

background-color: blue;
height: 100px;

The div is only there to structure and divide content


In our website the top part of the website: the title, subtutle and image are grouped
We can group using a div


1) Try moving heading and paragraph inside div

2) Give permenent background color to div
   style.css
div{
  background-color: #E4F9F5
}
Where to find colors? Color hunt.com
Why div does noot extend all the way till left and top?Browser inserts defautl css to style things
Check body element -> has margin 8 px from all edges
can change this body element  margin and observe change

Can we remove top margin also by changing div? No
Why? Check default rules for h1, can see margin in h1, have to change this


When we make change in margin for body
Everytime we reduce it to 0, code is added
margin-top and margin-bottom are edited
