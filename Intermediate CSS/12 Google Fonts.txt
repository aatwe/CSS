Using google fonts 

What if you realllyy want everyone to see the same viewing experience?
We will embed instead of presuming that people have it
Font embedding:
  fonts.google.com -> free -> embed in website (select style)
 	Articles on which font goes with which


After selecting -> Copy link -> Paste in index.html

If user does not have them installed -> browser takes them to location and grab fonts


Use these fonts in styles.css, default for backup
body{
    margin: 0;
    text-align: center;
    font-family: 'Merriweather', serif;
}
