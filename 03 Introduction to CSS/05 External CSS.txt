External stylesheet file is connected to several other webpages by <link rel= " " href = " " >
Earlier we added internal css to our index.html page

Here to make changes across all webpages

1) Make a CSS Folder in project

2) Create a css file css/styles.css  //this file is called stylesheet

Paste your css code without the style tag here
a) styles.css
body {
background-color: #EAF6F6		//Backgroundcolor property
height: 2px;
width: 30%
}

b) index.html
/* link */
<link rel ="stylesheet href="/css/master.css"">  /* Add this to contact me page also*
</head>

a) /css/master.css means root of file
b) css/master.css means same level of css folder
