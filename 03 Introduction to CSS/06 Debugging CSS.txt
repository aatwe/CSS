Why Debug?
A developer writes code that has flaws typos etc
Need to diagnose these bugs

Something not working as it is supposed to: find cause and fix

//How to check what effects without affecting code?
Ticking/Unticking CSS rulesin style.css Debugger developer mode
This changes how webpage is visible but does not change code


Q) how to debug
1) Specify problem clearly
2) isolate source code of problem
3) Using debugger -> take snapshot of code at time of error, note down all values and state at that time

4) use values -> locate cause -> trace program step by step(what is executing)

5)  check if bug resolved, check if new bug created or not
